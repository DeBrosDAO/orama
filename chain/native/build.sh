# Build the static native library for linux/amd64 (musl, C parts through zig): libwasmvm and the
# Orchard verifier in one archive, from source. Nothing prebuilt is downloaded.
#
# Usage: build.sh [build|verify]
#   build   writes $OUT/libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a (both Rust halves) and $OUT/liborama_orchard.a (empty:
#           the Go cgo directives of both libraries name their own archive, and the symbols of both are
#           in the first), and records the sha256 in native/libwasmvm_muslc.x86_64.a.sha256
#   verify  builds, then fails unless the sha256 equals the recorded one
#
# The wasmvm sources are libwasmvm from the Go module cache at the version chain/go.mod pins. The
# hash is only stable for the same Rust toolchain and zig; the recorded file names both.

# The archive must not depend on where the checkout lives. Cargo hashes a path dependency's location
# into every crate's metadata (and so into symbol names), and paths leak into debug strings, so the
# crate and its path dependency are built from one fixed directory, with that directory, the cargo
# home and the toolchain remapped. The recorded hash then matches a build from any checkout on any
# machine with the same toolchain. One build at a time: the directory is fixed.
