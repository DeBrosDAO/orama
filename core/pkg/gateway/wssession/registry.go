// Package wssession holds an open WebSocket to the credential that opened it.
//
// A WebSocket is authorized once, at the upgrade. Everything after that used to
// be on trust: a socket opened with a fifteen-minute token kept serving for as
// long as the client kept it open, and revoking the token — or signing the
// session out — reached every new request and no open socket.
//
// Every socket opened with a token is registered here with that token's
// claims, and a sweeper re-asks the two questions the upgrade asked, on a
// timer, for as long as the socket is open: has the token expired, and has it
// been revoked. A socket that fails either is closed with a code that says
// which.
