// The main gateway validates a request and forwards the result to a namespace
// gateway in the X-Internal-Auth-* headers: the namespace it resolved, the JWT
// subject it verified, and the grant set of the API key it looked up. The
// namespace gateway believes all three without re-checking anything.
//
// Whether to believe them was answered by the source IP, and the source IP of
// every public request is 127.0.0.1. Caddy terminates TLS and reverse-proxies
// to localhost, and it forwards client headers verbatim, so anyone on the
// internet could send
//
//	X-Internal-Auth-Validated: true
//	X-Internal-Auth-Namespace: <any namespace>
//	X-Internal-Auth-Scopes: admin
//
// and be an admin of any namespace on any gateway, holding no credential at
// all. The ownership gate skipped its checks for the same reason.
//
// The headers now carry a MAC over exactly what they assert, keyed by a value
// derived from the cluster secret, and the source IP is not consulted at all.
// A caller who does not hold the cluster secret cannot produce one, and a MAC
// captured from a harmless request cannot be replayed onto a different method,
// path, namespace, subject or grant set.
//
// The MAC comes in versions, each covering what the one before did and more. v1
// covers the fields above. v2 adds the verified token's exp, iat and jti, which
// a namespace gateway needs to hold an open WebSocket to the token that opened
// it: without them a socket proxied from the main gateway had no expiry, and no
// revocation could reach it. v3 adds the device and session the token is bound
// to.
//
// A signer stamps every version, so a namespace gateway that predates the
// newest still accepts what an upgraded main gateway sends it. A verifier
// judges a request by the newest MAC it carries, with no second chance under an
// older one, and deletes whatever that version does not cover before anything
// reads it — so a hop from a main gateway that predates v2 or v3, which exists
// only during a rolling upgrade, is believed exactly as far as it was signed.
// hopTokenTimes gives a hop with no token times the most time a token could
// have left, so a socket opened through it still ends.
//
// Accepting an older MAC gives nobody anything they did not have. Stripping the
// newer MAC off a genuine hop takes a position inside the WireGuard mesh, which
// is a node, and every node holds the cluster secret every version is keyed
// from — so whoever could downgrade a hop could sign one outright.
