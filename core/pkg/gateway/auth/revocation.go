// Revoking an API key stopped the key authenticating and did nothing to the
// JWTs already exchanged from it — up to fifteen minutes of full access after
// an operator had revoked the credential and been told it was done. Ending one
// session was not possible at all: logout dropped the refresh token and left
// the access token valid.
//
// A token is now checked against a list of revocations on every request. The
// list is small (only revocations whose tokens have not yet expired are in it)
// and is held in memory, refreshed on a timer, because a database round trip
// per request costs a cross-region hop and this runs on every authenticated
// call.
//
// A revocation takes effect within RevocationStaleness. Fifteen minutes became
// ten seconds, which is the point. The list is reloaded at half that, because
// the bound is not the interval alone: the copy a request reads is as old as
// the read that filled it began, which is up to one interval plus the time the
// reload takes, and on a loaded registry that is seconds (stagenet, 2026-09-30:
// a reload every ten seconds took fifteen to reach a gateway).

	// milliseconds, so one that has taken three seconds is hung, and waiting
	// the full ten on every request during a registry hang only delays the 503
	// the client is going to get. It is also under RevocationRefreshInterval,
