// Package ctrlauth is how a namespace's gateways and its SFUs trust each other.
//
// The SFU listens on the WireGuard overlay, where every namespace's services
// live, so being on the overlay proves nothing about who is calling. Three
// things cross between a gateway and an SFU, and each carries a MAC keyed by a
// value derived from the namespace's own TURN secret (which both ends already
// hold, and no end user does):
//
//   - a join ticket, gateway to SFU, on the signalling upgrade: who the
//     gateway authenticated, for which room, and whether the namespace
//     admitted them. The SFU takes the peer's identity from the ticket and
//     from nowhere else.
//   - a control request, gateway to SFU (kick, mute).
//   - a membership event, SFU to gateway (join, leave).
//
// The key is per namespace, so an SFU of one namespace can neither forge a
// ticket for another's nor report into it. It is derived under its own
// purpose, so it is unrelated to the TURN credentials the same secret signs.
